A mobile app is built where the user can search for his nearby locations based on his requirement. Whenever the user gives input of business type like a hotel, petrol pumps, hospitals, etc. using Place API and as a response we obtain the co-ordinates that are marked on the Google map.

Additional Feature
------------

- <b>Digital Grocery List</b> - As we can't remember everything, users frequently go to store & forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of <b>GoStore</b> app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything.
